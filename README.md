# ElGamalCryptosystem

## DESCRIPTION
This is a Python-based GUI application for encrypting and decrypting messages using the principles of the ElGamal cryptosystem. This program will use randomly generated or manually entered prime numbers, primitive roots, and exponents for its operation.

## FEATURES
Random Value Generation: Automatically generates prime numbers, primitive roots, and exponents for encryption.
Manual Entry: Allows users to manually input prime numbers, primitive roots, and exponents.
Message Encryption: Encrypts messages based on the provided values.
Message Decryption: Placeholder for decryption logic, to be implemented.
User Interface: Simple GUI for user interaction, built with tkinter.
Reset and Exit Options: Reset all input fields or exit the application easily.

## REQUERIMENTS
Python 3.x
tkinter (included with standard Python installation)
random module (included with standard Python installation)
PyInstaller (for creating an executable)

## USING
Generate Random Values: Click on "Generate Random" to auto-fill the fields with random prime number, primitive root, and exponent.

Manual Entry: Fill in the prime number, primitive root, and exponent manually. Click on "Enter Manually" to validate and use these values.

Encrypt Message: Enter the message in the "Message" field and click "Encrypt". The encrypted message will be displayed in the corresponding field.

Decrypt Message: Enter the encrypted message in the "Encrypted Message" field and click "Decrypt". The placeholder for the decrypted message will be displayed.

Reset to clear all input fields.

Exit to close the application.
